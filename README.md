**Unlock code: 896471;**
     **Lock code: 896474**

2.`testrandom.java` guesses the unlock code inputing random digits from 0 to 9 and outputs the number of digits has been generated before the lock was unlocked. Also it performs another test when `testrandom.java` guessing the unlock code for 20 times and finds the min, max and average of number of digits has been generated to unlock the lock.
